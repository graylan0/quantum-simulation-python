Python script to simulate the time evolution of a quantum system governed by the Schrödinger equation using a simple potential barrier scenario. In this example, we will calculate the probability of a wave packet passing through a potential barrier. This simulation is based on the Schrödinger equation, which is one of the listed equations.

This script simulates the time evolution of a Gaussian wave packet approaching a potential barrier. The wave packet is initially located at x0, and its probability density is displayed on the top subplot. The potential
