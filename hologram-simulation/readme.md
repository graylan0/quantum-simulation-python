Given your interest in exploring the encoding of 3D hologram information onto a 2D surface using the theories of Schrödinger equation, Pauli exclusion principle, and the Hamiltonian operator, I can provide you with a simple Python script that simulates a basic 3D object and projects it onto a 2D plane.

However, it is important to note that the provided script is not directly related to the AdS/CFT correspondence or quantum gravity. It's a simple demonstration of a 3D to 2D projection, which could be an initial step toward understanding the concept of holographic encoding.

This script creates a 3D object with random points, projects it onto a 2D plane, and plots the projection. It doesn't incorporate the Schrödinger equation, Pauli exclusion principle, or Hamiltonian operator, as these principles are more relevant to quantum mechanics and not directly applicable to a simple geometric projection.

To integrate these principles, you will need to define a more complex simulation, perhaps involving quantum systems or quantum gravity. Additionally, simulating these principles would require advanced knowledge in physics, mathematics, and specialized computational frameworks.
 It's a simple demonstration of projecting a 3D object onto a 2D surface, which can help you understand the concept of encoding higher-dimensional information onto lower-dimensional structures.

Keep in mind that the script provided is a basic example and not directly related to the AdS/CFT correspondence or quantum gravity. To study those topics, you would need a more sophisticated simulation involving a deeper understanding of the underlying physics and mathematical principles.

If you have any more questions or would like further clarification or guidance, please feel free to ask!

Simulating quantum gravity or the AdS/CFT correspondence in a Python script is a complex task that requires a deep understanding of advanced physics and mathematics, as well as specialized computational frameworks. However, I can provide you with a Python script that simulates a simple lattice in a lower-dimensional spacetime, which can be a basic starting point to explore more complex concepts in quantum gravity.

This script creates a 2D lattice representing spacetime discretized into points, which is a simple way to visualize a lower-dimensional spacetime often used in lattice quantum gravity studies.
