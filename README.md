# quantum-simulation-python
 A collection of Python scripts for simulating various quantum systems and phenomena, inspired by fundamental equations in quantum mechanics.
Scripts included:

`hologram_simulation.py`

This script explores the AdS/CFT correspondence by encoding 3D information onto a 2D surface using a hologram simulation. This is achieved by simulating a wave packet passing through a potential barrier.

`quantum_harmonic_oscillator.py`

This script simulates a quantum harmonic oscillator by solving the time-independent Schrödinger equation. It calculates the energy eigenvalues and plots the energy levels.

`potential_barrier_simulation.py`

This script simulates the time evolution of a Gaussian wave packet approaching a potential barrier. The wave packet's probability density is displayed, and the system's behavior is governed by the Schrödinger equation.

`infinite_square_well.py`

This script computes the wave functions and energy levels of a particle in a one-dimensional infinite square well potential. It plots the wave functions and energy levels for the first few quantum states, inspired by the time-independent Schrödinger equation and the wave-particle duality equation.
These scripts provide insights into various quantum systems and phenomena by simulating their behavior based on fundamental equations in quantum mechanics. The visualizations offer an intuitive understanding of these systems, allowing users to explore their properties and underlying principles.
