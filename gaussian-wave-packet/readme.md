 The simulation demonstrates the time evolution of a Gaussian wave packet in a harmonic oscillator potential. The moving line you see represents the probability density of the particle's position, which evolves over time according to the principles of quantum mechanics.

This example showcases the wave-particle duality principle, one of the fundamental aspects of quantum mechanics. The particle can be described as a wave with its probability density spread out in space, while still exhibiting particle-like behavior.

Feel free to explore other aspects of quantum mechanics, tweak the parameters in the script, or investigate different scenarios. If you have any further questions or need assistance, don't hesitate to ask.
