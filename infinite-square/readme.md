This script computes the wave functions and energy levels of a particle in a one-dimensional infinite square well potential. It plots the wave functions and energy levels for the first few quantum states. The energy levels are determined by solving the time-independent Schrödinger equation in the context of an infinite square well potential, which is directly inspired by the Schrödinger equation and wave-particle duality equation.
